		<!-- Information -->
		<p>
		There is no better way to enjoy the great scenery than to surround yourself with it. Between
		the formidable cliffs in the Rocky Mountain National Park, the highest sand dunes of North America 
		in the Great Sand Dunes National Park, and the majestic Pikes Peak in Pike National Forest, 
		there is great beauty to found everywhere you turn. Immerse yourself with nature and take a 
		day trip to one of these great parks. Have yourself a picnic and enjoy the landscape.
		</p>
		<p>
		Now if natural parks aren't up your alley of fun then perhaps a raging roller 
		coaster ride is for you. The Elitch Gardens Theme and Water Park in Denver is America's only 
		amusement park located in the downtown area of a major city. This 120-year-old park
		has edge-of-your-seat extreme thrills right next to skyscrapers! What a blast! But, if you
		are not in Denver, check out the Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park in Glenwood Springs. Known not only for
		awesome rides but spectacular caverns to explore. It's a whole another adventure in among itself.
