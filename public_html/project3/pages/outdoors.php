		<!-- Rock climbing information -->
		<p>
		First, start off with some great rocking climbing. If you're new to the sport,
		take on some bouldering at the Rocky Mountain Outdoor Center. Not only will 
		you have fun, this climbing school will also prepare you for some huge heights. 
		With some experience under your harness, it's time to scale some cliffs. Drive on over
		to the San Juan Mountain range. On the way there, grab some gear and a helmet at any
		local outfitter. Now you are ready to climb some serious stones!
		</p>
		
		<!-- Rafting information -->
		<p>
		It's time to cool off after some rock climbing! Every spring season, when snow comes down sliding 
		down the mountains and into the Colorado rivers, rafting trips begin to set sail. Hop aboard a bright,
		neon ship and prepare for the ride of your life! You'll splash through raging rapids and crash into glistening waterfalls!
		It is sure to be wet and wild. To get started, the Royal George Rafting Tour company and 
		The Adventure Company are known for great rafting tours. Check these companies out and set a date to ride the river!
		</p>
		
		<!-- Hang Gliding information -->
		<p>
		Well, you've conquered the land and water. It is time to master the air! What better way to do
		it than hang gliding and paragliding. Travel up to a high hilltop and dive into the breeze. Slowly float 
		across the landscape as you descend in either a a parachute or glider. The scenery is amazing at those heights!
		Fly into the Mile High Gliding company in Boulder, Colorado.  It's a great one stop shop for your aerial desires!
