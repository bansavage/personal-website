			Autumn is the time for cool temperatures and warm drinks. So come clink glasses
			with others at the Breckenridge Craft Spirits Festival on October 24th. At the festival, there will 
			be small-batch distillers, handcrafted spirits by the finest artisans, great food, and
			beer sampling. Throughout the event there will be live music as well to ensure a 
			rootin' and hootin' time! It's free too!<br><br>

		All this month, Theatre-Hikes will be performing three scenes from Edgar Allan Poe's works, "The Raven," the
		"Tell Tale Heart" and the "Fall of the House of Usher". Differing from a normal play, Theatre-Hikes 
		focuses on hiking into the woods and gathering around the actors as they perform. It's hiking and entertainment
		rolled into one! Tickets are $20. If you come, dress warm and bring a camping chair! <br><br>
