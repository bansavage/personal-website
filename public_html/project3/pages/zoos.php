		<p>
		Are you an animal lover? Need a fun thing to do with the kids? Then a zoo is for you!
		Come see wild animals from all every corner of the globe. There are lions, tigers, and even bears
		for you to see at The Wild Animal Sanctuary. Need something with more of a bite? The Colorado
		Gators Farm is a sure please then. See 11 foot long gators that weigh over 500 pounds in all their glory.
		After that, swing by the Downtown Aquarium in Denver to view animals on a smaller scale. Browse massive 
		exhibits that hold exotic fish from waters around the world. With so many different animals to see,
		you are sure to have a "wild life"!
