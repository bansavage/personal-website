		<!-- Information -->
		<p>
		Any history buff knows that the best part of visiting a new location is a chance
		to immerse themselves in wonderful, informative history. Lucky for them, Colorado is
		full of western history. The Old Town Museum and Railroad Museum provide
		glimpses back to the days of old. The past comes bubbling back up and it's up to you 
		to dive in. Read every plaque and examine every ancient artifact until your head is full
		of Colorado's past.
		</p>
		<p>
		If history is not your suite, then enjoying art from the state is perfect for you.
		The Denver Art Museum and Leanin' Tree Museum & Sculpture Garden of Western Art will 
		satisfy your cultural cravings. Both offer excellent forms of art, from massive, metallic sculptures 
		to serene oil paintings.
