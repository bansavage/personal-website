		Travel to Cherry Creek Shopping Center, the Grand Junction, or the Castle Rock Outlets! At these 
		fine locations, you can buy anything that is to your heart's (and wallet's) content. There are hundreds
		of brand name stores to keep you looking as stylish as ever. Waltz down the posh, ritzy shopping centres and 
		mingle with the best dressed folk in western United States. However, in the midst of buying all the great fashion available here,
		don't forget about hand-crafted jewelry, collectibles, art, and historical memorabilia. 
		</p>
		<p>
		But wait, there's more! No vacation is complete without a bag full of souvenirs. Everyone loves a personal little
		artifact from an adventure. Pick up some "I Love Colorado" shirts and coffee mugs so that you can remember 
		all the fond memories that you created here in golden Colorado!
