		<p>
		First, let's cover the food. Colorado offers incredible fine dining experiences found only in this gorgeous state.
		Restaurants strive for superb quality and offer food straight from local farms. You can taste the fresh, home grown 
		goodness that embodies every meal. Besides garden ripe food, Colorado also offers tons of Mexican and Spanish cuisine 
		to incorporate a great south western menu. You cannot go wrong with any meal here!
		</p>
		<p>
		Of course, there are hundreds of tantalizing, bubbling elixirs to enjoy from when dining. Choose from brews crafted
		with love and wine fermented to perfection. Drink to your heart's content and, when you are ready for another round,
		take a tour of any of the amazing wineries and breweries in this state. Everything is better with a little red wine, even rock
		climbing!
