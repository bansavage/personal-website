			Perhaps natural beauty is not all that interesting. Maybe you crave some past 
			knowledge. Sounds like a museum is the best fit for you. There are vast collections of historic items and incredible old tales of the wild west 
			waiting right around the corner, ready to be seen. Our museums can tell history better than any book ever will. And, if history does not
			tickle your fancy, perhaps an art gallery is what you need. Do not fret partner! There is a scratch for that itch as well. <br><br>

			If adventure sports are too extreme then meandering through a stunningly gorgeous park is the activity made for you.
			Enjoy wildlife without the adrenaline rush. However, if you start to crave the need for a rush, cruise over to one of Colorado's superb 
			amusement parks for a raging good time!<br><br>
